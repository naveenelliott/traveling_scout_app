        Welcome to the first ever soccer (or football, depending where you're from) scout routing optimization app that utilizes optimization 
        techniques to effectively route scouts to soccer games. The optimization algorithm uses distances from stadiums and an formula that quantifies team talent to determine the best route
         for scouts to take in order to maximize their efficiency and effectiveness in scouting players. We will have an additional article that goes into more detail on our 
         processes coming out soon, but for now if you have any questions, suggestions, or contributions, feel free to reach out to our socials below!
